# Chess Game Project

A simple implementation of a chess game in Java. This project allows players to play chess on the command line. For this project, I am trying to focus on keeping it Object-Orientated and have every method confined in it's self.
Let me know if you have any suggestions or questions!

## Features

Plays a chess game with standard rules. Allows for playing with 2 Players or against a computer.
